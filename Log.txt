about
start

Day 1 

- added rigidbody2d to player.
- added ontriggerenter to script and collider to both.
- player smashes, add force to raise it up then let it fall under gravity.(fix)
  -> addforce set to 700, seems good.
  -> disable collider.
- pipe moves, set speed variable to increase speed with time.
  -> added float for it.
  -> wouldn't need speed but gap distance
- spawn location is fixed. (wont need)
  -> set an int or location object, in successive manner so pipe spawns at different heights at spawn
     location. pass that int, which is random to spawn obsctales.
- dont need to spawn, can just repeat pipes at different location.
  -> pipes already present from start.(fix)
  -> wouldn't need a spawner also.
  -> wouldn't need a prefab also.(fix)(for now prefab)(wrong)
  -> wont need a height variable, can use random also(fix)
- the gap gets smaller with difficulty.(fix)
  -> woulf only require 1 variable as y position will be same with opposite signs
- 6 pipes in both upper and lower separately
- pipes dont move properly(fix)
  -> 4 spaces between pipes
- wont need 2 move point if y will be random, 1 will do (fix)
- frame reduces after some seconds
  -> can contain 2 pipes in 1 object and object will have script, so less script running
  -> changed update to fixedupdate solved it for now, cpu: main is 9.8
- pipes move correctly but can do the grouping method if this becomes slow.
- PIpeUp - 1.31, PipeDown - 0.6
- made pipes pair up, make code for it.(fix)

Day 2

- make pipe appear in more random heights
  -> currently appear in pair, if sequence go up then goes down. i.e. if 3 up then 3 down 
- stop game if player is smashed
  -> Pipe stop moving.
  -> Game Over Menu Appears.
- made game over sprites
- coins will be on basis of places, since game will be new so 1st player will get gold, then 
  when someone beats him, he will get gold and previous switches to silver and so on (fix)
- space to start the game or start button.(fix)
  -> countdown 3 to 0 before game starts.
- if game paused, show resume? or press pause again.(fix)
  -> if resumed then show countdown.
  -> display get ready!!
- game starts, gravity is 0, then prep player to gravity 2.0(fix)
- close the gap to 3.5, more than that should not be possible, i think.(fix)
- for every 20 collected raise speed, for evry 40 close gap
- change tag of obstacle (fix)
- only individual pipe gap changes, in a different manner as well...(fix)
  ->can move stats change method to update for performance.(fix)
- only 1 prefab changes, rest remains same (fixed)
- speed change is good but gap change is not (fixed)
  -> speed inverses
- wait for set to 3 sec just in case.
- set countdown to null instead of turning it off.
- space works before game starts(fix)
- player pause work not properly(fix)
- pipes dont move backward while loading Menu.(fix)
- bird falls out of canvas so game over(fix)
- dont know how but pipe start point fixed itslef, pipe start point.x = 9f.(fix)
  -> did not fix this!!!
- if game begins again, pipes are straight.
- score changes as it drops.(fixed)
- remove about, use little credits at bottom.(fiX)


- font is 04b_19.(fiX)
- set screen resolution.(fix)
- death makes invisible player.(fixed)
- full screen does not show exit or other above buttons.(fix)
- if space is pressed and die then gets extra bounce.(fix)
- set upper limit.(fix)
- after main menu space works.(fix)
- play an anim after pause game resumed or game over.
- try saving at least 4 high scores for now.(do)
  -> loop through data to find highest or sort the data per se.
     :- 1st save will be empty.
	 :- last score will be pushed out if a new high score is made.
	 :- have to make a new array for copy.
- if paused, if pressed main menu, update high score.(fix)
- do scoreboard.(fix)
- 2 files are created at game over.(fix)
  -> 1 more created if main menu pressed.
  -> score doesnt update in main menu after a game.
- if player touches point, it is added.(fix)
- load high score doesnt work properly, made another function.
- maybe save script is called if player dies.
- score is replaced however
  -> if current score is higher than 2nd score, then replace 2nd score. So have to compare the whole
     data.
  -> did not account for duplicates.(fix)
- Thank You.(fix)
- player dies, game over called again.(fix)
- game over fix done, but can still see player falling.
- if press main menu immediately after game over, main menu overlay above game over and bird can be seen 
   falling(fix)
